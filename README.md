This is a Microsoft Excel Project focused on understanding employee attrition patterns. This project was carried out in an attempt to analyze and monitor employee attrition trends within an organization. 

Employee attrition analytics focused on identifying why employees voluntarily leave, what might prevented them from leaving, and how we can use data to predict attrition risk. In addition, this type of employee predictive analytics can be used to help organizations understand and design the interventions that will be most effective in reducing unwanted attrition.
